          During a 2 week sprint at Loblaw Digital, I defined searchable select
          menu interactions for our internal Campaign Manager, reducing
          production time and enabling the production of personalized campaigns
          at scale. In one year, the difference in revenue between personalized
          campaigns built in Campaign Manager and non-personalized campaigns was
          +5.8M.
        </p>
        <div class="text-group">
          <h2>My role</h2>
          <p>
            In January 2024, I joined the personalization team at Loblaw
            Digital. Our team was responsible for our internal Campaign Manager,
            a campaign management tool used by our colleagues to produce
            personalized campaigns for 1M+ customers across Canada. When I
            joined, Campaign Manager had just launched the previous month.

          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Because unique content must be created for every audience
                segment, campaign personalization requires more content. Menus
                on our interface connected to our content databases were
                growing, and items became more and more difficult for colleagues
                to find.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Personalized campaign production is repetitive – a unique
                campaign is created for every audience segment – so our
                colleagues interfaced with these long menus on a day-to-day.
                Colleagues reported frustration because they had to repeatedly
                find items buried within our long menus.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                In order for personalized campaign production to scale, even
                more content needs to be created, which means menus will only
                get longer.

                Task-analysis validated that our colleagues only need to filter
                our menus after typing a keyword, but providing additional
                search suggestions was not necessary

                <p>
                  I learned that ideally, colleagues want to see all menu items
                  immediately on focus: <i
                    >”If I immediately see the [item] I need to find in the
                    menu, I can just click on it there”</i

              <li>
                <p>
                  If it is not possible to show all menu items, the menu can be
                  set to a max. height for each use case

            <h3>Menu items must be sorted alphabetically</h3>
            <p>
              The current experience listed items in alphabetical order, and
              this was validated by our colleagues to be a good experience –
              <i
                >The [items] are listed in alphabetical order, which is helpful
                in finding what we need right now”</i

          <div class="text-group">
            <h3>Menu items must be parsable from anywhere</h3>
            <p>
              Menu items in our internal systems had legacy names with prefixes
              that were unintuitive. Our colleagues should be able to ignore
              prefixes upon search.

              Furthermore, menu items in our internal systems had legacy names
              formatted in camelCase. Our colleagues should not have to remember
              which characters in the target item are upper or lowercase.

            <p>
              The searchable select menu reused existing input field and menu
              components, but I had to consider how these two components would
              speak to each another. What is the height of the menu? How should
              we handle case-sensitivity? Solutions were found by thinking about
              how our colleagues work and validated as feasible by the tech
              team.

              It was less intuitive to foresee how user research had a role in
