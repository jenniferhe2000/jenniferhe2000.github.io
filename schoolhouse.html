            In Summer 2022, I interned at schoolhouse.world, a Sal Khan
            initiative building ed-tech products. I was tasked to lead design of
            the Teacher Tools MVP, which was launched to 200+ students and
            teachers at Khan World School (KWS). After the first school year,
            while using Teacher Tools and schoolhouse.world products, student
            test score improvement was reported to be ~4x the typical growth
            across math, reading and language arts.

            <p>
              Teachers need to understand the needs of their class so they know
              who to support and how. However, KWS is fully remote and
              self-paced. Each student in a course will progress at their own
              pace, so teachers don’t know which of their students are
              struggling vs. advancing.

              Both Khan World School and Schoolhouse.world world are

              we educate. Schoolhouse.world needed to demonstrate that our
              products can facilitate student-teacher success better than the
              status quo.

            <p>
              During one of weekly product-tech-design syncs, I didn’t feel
              comfortable sharing my work with team members because I felt like
              I hadn’t made any decisions and was still exploring options. Upon
              sharing however, I received very valuable and directional
              feedback.

            <h3>Collaborating in parallel with engineers</h3>
            <p>
              Because of deadlines, design and engineering worked in parallel.
              It was difficult knowing their work was dependent on my work;
              however, I learned to be transparent about my personal timelines
              and honest when I felt as though I didn’t have a solution right
              away. To avoid ad-hoc design solutions, I felt a responsibility to
              state when I needed an additional day to explore alternatives and
              possibly review with my senior designer. In general, transparency
              meant we could work together to figure out our dependencies.
